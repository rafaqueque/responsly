# Responsly
Defunct at the moment. Maybe in the (near) future. Oh, and sorry for using PHP,
but when I started last summer I was feeling very comfortable with it.
Maybe I'll rewrite the entire app in Django/Python. 

## What's working
* Almost all views
* Payment system
* Server checks

## What is used
* Backend entirely written from scratch (I tought it was a good idea... right)
* Toro
* Bootstrap for front-end

## Instructions
No instructions at the moment, but I'll add them as soon as possible. Shouldn't
be difficult to get it up and running.

* Install MySQL, PHP and Apache
* Import the database dump (.sql file)
* Run the server

That's it.
